It's essentially a variable whose value is a numerical outcome of a random phenomenon. These variables can be either discrete or continuous, depending on whether the outcomes can be counted or measured on a continuous scale."

In probability theory and statistics, the discrete uniform distribution is a symmetric probability distribution wherein each of some finite whole number n of outcome values are equally likely to be observed.

The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) is a fundamental concept in statistics that states that when you take a large enough sample from any population, the distribution of the sample means will be approximately normal, regardless of the original population's distribution.

        "\n",
        "Ans. In statistics, a point estimate is a single value used to estimate an unknown population parameter, while an interval estimate provides a range of values within which the population parameter is likely to lie. Point estimates offer a \"best guess\" of a parameter, while interval estimates offer a measure of the accuracy of that guess by providing a range of plausible values.\n",

        "An interval estimate, also known as a confidence interval, provides a range of values within which the population parameter is expected to fall, with a specified level of confidence. For example, a 95% confidence interval for the population mean would be a range of values for which there is a 95% chance that the true population mean falls within that range.\n",

        "Ans. A z-score and a confidence interval are related through the concept of margin of error. The z-score, which represents the number of standard deviations a data point is away from the mean, is used in calculating the margin of error, which in turn defines the boundaries of the confidence interval. Essentially, the z-score helps determine how many standard deviations to extend from the sample mean to capture a specific percentage of the population, thus defining the confidence interval.\n",

        "\n",
        "Ans. Z-scores are used to compare different distributions by standardizing data points, allowing for direct comparison across datasets with varying means and standard deviations. A z-score represents how many standard deviations a data point is from the mean of its distribution, effectively converting all data into a common scale. This standardized measure, with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1, facilitates comparisons of data points from different datasets, even if their original scales are different.\n",
